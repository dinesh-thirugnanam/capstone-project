# Capstone-Project: Real-Time Geospatial Tracking App

## Capstone Project

---

### Overview for Reviewers

This is a capstone project focused on developing a cross-platform mobile application for real-time geospatial tracking and location sharing. The project is in its initial phase, with key objectives being to demonstrate proficiency in full-stack development (React Native, Node.js, PostgreSQL/PostGIS, Supabase) and to deliver a robust, user-centric mapping application. Features will include interactive maps, secure authentication, and modern UI/UX.

### Guide for Developers

#### Multi-Branch Workflow

- `main`: Stable, deployable version.
- `frontend`: React Native (Expo) mobile app development.
- `backend`: Node.js/Express API.
- `infra`: Infrastructure scripts, DB migrations, and deployment configs.
- Feature branches: Use `feature/<short-description>`, `bugfix/<short-description>`, or `chore/<task>`, branching from the relevant stack branch.

#### Setup

1. **Clone the repo**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/capstone-project.git
    ```

2. **Switch to the appropriate branch**
    ```
    git checkout frontend    # for mobile app code
    git checkout backend     # for API code
    ```

3. **Install dependencies and run locally** (see per-branch README files for commands)

#### Contribution Guidelines

- Open issues for bugs or proposed features.
- Use pull requests for all merges into `main`, with peer code review.
